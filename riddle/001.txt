A thief lies on six days of the week, But on one day- the same day each week-he only tells the truth. On three consecutive days, he says:

Day 1: I lie on Monday and Tuesday.

Day 2: Itâ€™s now Thursday, Saturday or Sunday.

Day 3: I lie on Wednesday and Friday.

Which day does the thief tell the truth?
